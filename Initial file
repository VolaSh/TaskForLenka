You know it's the place I need
But you got me walking circles like a dog on a lead
And the doctors say I'm crazy, that I'm eight miles thick
I'm like the taste of macaroni on a seafood stick

New Line

And you got me switched on, baby, like electric eel
And I'm tight with Axel Foley, that's just how I feel
Like a grapefruit and a magic trick, the prodigal son
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking, I walk so quick
